# Android Notification Speaker

This app utilizes the Android Notification Service to create a Notification Listener, thereby allowing certain notifications (currently Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts) to be intercepted and acted upon.

For each notification we create an audible announcement via the Android Text To Speech Service and proceed to read out the message body of the notification.
